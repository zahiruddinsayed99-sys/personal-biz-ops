## Milestone 6: Billing & Subscription Engine - QA Verification Guide
1. Database Migrations
Verify: Run alembic upgrade head. Check the organizations table in PostgreSQL to ensure new fields (subscription_tier, subscription_status, stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id, gstin, billing_state, ai_credits_used, bonus_ai_credits, last_billing_event_ts) exist and have proper defaults.
Expected Outcome: Table structures updated without data loss.
2. Stripe Checkout & Portal Endpoints
Verify Checkout (POST /api/v1/billing/checkout):
Authenticate as a tenant owner.
Call the endpoint to get a Stripe Checkout URL.
Verify that the URL initiates a checkout session in INR currency with 3D Secure options enabled.
If a GSTIN was provided in the organization, ensure the tax ID is mapped correctly.
Verify Portal (POST /api/v1/billing/portal):
Authenticate as a tenant owner for an organization with an active Stripe Customer ID.
Call the endpoint to get a Stripe Customer Portal URL.
Check that the URL directs the user to the Stripe manage subscription page.
3. Stripe Webhook Receiver
Verify Webhook (POST /api/v1/billing/webhooks):
Send a forged signature and ensure it fails with 401 Unauthorized.
Send a valid signature with an out-of-order created timestamp and check that it safely discards (200 OK).
Send a valid event (customer.subscription.updated / deleted) and verify the Redis 3-state locking ensures it processes exactly once (test idempotency).
Expected Outcome: DB subscription_tier updates to PRO/FREE appropriately based on status.
4. Atomic Usage Metering & Downgrade
Verify Atomic Usage:
Run the consume_ai_credits_br_plt_002 function concurrently.
Ensure the check-and-increment properly hits limits at exactly 100 on the FREE tier, failing any transaction that exceeds the limit with a 402 Payment Required.
Verify Soft-Lock Downgrade:
Set a tenant's subscription to FREE and add > 3 active users.
Attempt to execute operations in CRM pipeline or invite users.
Expected Outcome: Operations fail with HTTP 402 ERR_BILLING_001 (Soft-locked). Read operations should still succeed.
5. Frontend Billing Dashboard
Verify Standalone Component:
Navigate to /billing path.
Check the component displays current subscription tier, active plan status, and dynamic usage meters.
Ensure the GSTIN form enforces the 15-character alphanumeric format.
Test checkout/portal button clicks redirect properly.
If the account is soft-locked, ensure the warning alert is visible.
6. Run Integration Tests
Verify: Execute pytest tests/test_billing_integration.py -v.
Expected Outcome: Tests for forged webhooks, redis double-spend protection, atomic limits, and soft-lock downgrade pass successfully.
